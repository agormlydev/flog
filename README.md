TODO: 
 - check return error codes
 - deal with file open and write failures
 - add other levels of logging
 - add support for file paths with wide chars
 - doxygen comments and document generation

To compile, must be in an environment with cl.exe and other similar environment variables set.
Easiest way to do that is to use one of the vcvars.bat files included with Visual Studio. Or just use a Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt.
